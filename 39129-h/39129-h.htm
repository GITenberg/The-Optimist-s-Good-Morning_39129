<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>Once family devotions were general, now they
are rare. There are reasons for the change. One
reason is that the simplicity of the old family life
is gone. It is not easy to get all the members of the
family together at any one time in the day. A part
of this is due to less leisure now than formerly.
Men must catch trains in the morning. In the
evening they are distracted by manifold social engagements.</p>

<p>Yet the need of spiritual adjustment is ever the
same. Rapid transit, the telephone, the telegraph,
do not take the place of God. Indeed the more
rapid pace involved in these modern pace-makers,
renders the more necessary some pause in the day
for prayer, some upward look, when for a moment
the soul may find an open way between itself and
God. But how and when? Why not the breakfast
table? Surely one or two minutes may be spared.
Thirty seconds of silence, then the reading of a
noble sentiment from some one who has been thinking
for us,&mdash;another pause,&mdash;and a few words of
prayer, framed by some one with more leisure than
we have, but who puts us in the mood of prayer
and so starts us right upon the duties of the day,&mdash;this
will bring the needed readjustment.</p>

<p>Such is the plan and purpose of this little book.
It is made for busy men and women, who <i>need</i> to
begin the day with God. The quotations for each
day are brief, but they are gleaned from the great
Masters of thought. The prayers are from devout
men of all the denominations.</p>

<p>As the title will have suggested, both quotations
and prayers are generally in the spirit of a truly
optimistic faith. However life may look in the
middle of the night, it is a good thing to start out
to do the work of the day with hope and courage.
I shall be glad if I can feel that this little book has
helped some busy people to begin the day in this
spirit. I shall be particularly glad if I can feel that
it has helped a little to keep the candles lighted on
the family altar.</p>

<p>January 1</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Throughout the year, why not keep sweet? No
frown ever made a heart glad; no complaint ever
made a dark day bright; no bitter word ever lightened
a burden or made a rough road smooth; no grumbling
ever introduced sunshine into a home. What the
world needs is the resolute step, the look of cheer, the
smiling countenance, and the kindly word. Keep
sweet!</i></p></blockquote>

<p>God of the years, our Heavenly Father, whatever
the message of the old year may have been, whether
of darkness or light, joy or sorrow,&mdash;we stand this
morning waiting expectantly and confidently for
some message with glad tidings. May we therefore
enter upon the New Year in the mood of hope and
good cheer,&mdash;brushing from our faces every sign
of care, let us go forth into the New Year with the
spirit of a child who puts his hand into the hand of
a Father to be led into a field where the flowers
blossom and the birds sing. Not for to-day only
do we pray for sweetness and light, but let us be
glad and happy every day. Thou art with us today,&mdash;Thou
wilt be with us through all the journey of
the year. May our own daily gladness be born of
the conviction that Thou art always near. Amen.</p>

<p>Thou Infinite Spirit, we are glad of all human
relationships. We are thankful for all companionship
with nature. We rejoice in the fellowship with
books, yet like the child who grows tired with every
plaything and every childish task and lonely for a
mother's love, we look to Thee with an infinite longing.
In our effort to solve the problems of life, we
throw our web of life hither and thither, but it will
not hold. Only when at last we have thrown the
thread of faith to Thee, shall the ductile anchor
hold. Our Heavenly Father, as we go forth into
this day, may we not leave Thee for any dream or
phantom, but may we walk with Thee all day long,
and find in Thee the answer to every longing and
the solution of every problem. Though we may not
see, we may trust and wait. Amen.</p>

The planet, the pebble, goes attended by its shadow.
The rolling rock leaves its scratches on the mountain;
the river, its channel in the soil; the animal, its

epitaph in the coal. The falling drop makes its
sculpture in the sand or the stone. Not a foot steps
into the snow or along the ground, but prints, in
characters more or less lasting, a map of its march.
Every act of the man inscribes itself in the memory

multitude, and begin to repeat to myself&mdash;just as

according as I have time, some sayings of Christ

let prayer be the first employment in the early morning,
and the last in the evening. Avoid diligently those
false and deceptive thoughts which say, Wait a little,
I will pray an hour hence; I must first perform

<blockquote><p><i>In one of Dean Stanley's sermons to children,
preached at Westminster Abbey, he told the following
story: "There was a little girl living with her grandfather.
She was a good child, but he was not a very
good man; and one day, when the little child came
back from school, he had put in writing over the bed,
'God is nowhere,' for he did not believe in the good
God, and he tried to make the little child believe the
same. What did the little girl do? She had no eyes
to see, no ears to hear, what her grandfather tried
to teach her. She was very small. She could only
read words of one syllable at a time; she rose above
the bad meaning which he tried to put in her mind;
she rose, as we all ought to rise, above the temptation
of our time; she rose into a higher and better world;
she rose because her little mind could not do otherwise,
and she read the words, not 'God is nowhere,'
but 'God is now here.' That is what we all should
strive to do. Out of words which have no sense or
which have bad sense, our eyes, our minds, ought to
be able to read a better sense."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Father of life, we thank Thee that Thou hast
been with the Fathers; that Thou hast been with
him whose birth this day we celebrate. Thou wert
willing to speak to them, and they were willing to
hear Thee and answer Thee, "Lo, here am I; send
me." We thank Thee that the memory of this great
man has come down to us; of him who was first
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen; and we ask Thee that Thou wilt be
with our countrymen today; that Thou wilt teach
us Thy law, that we may walk in Thy ways; that
this may be that happy nation whose God is the
Lord. In all time of our trial, if we have sought
Thee we have found Thee,&mdash;in all time of our

<blockquote><p><i>There is no music in a rest, but there is the making
of music in it. In our whole life melody, the music
is broken off here and there by "rests," and we foolishly
think we have come to the end of time. God sends a
time of forced leisure&mdash;sickness, disappointed plans,
frustrated efforts&mdash;and makes a sudden pause in
the choral hymn of our lives, and we lament that our
voices must be silent, and our part missing in the
music which ever goes up to the ear of the Creator.
How does the musician read the rest? See him beat
time with unvarying count and catch up the next
note true and steady, as if no breaking place had come
in between. Not without design does God write the
music of our lives. But be it ours to learn the time,
and not be dismayed at the "rests." They are not
to be slurred over, nor to be omitted, nor to destroy
the melody, nor to change the key-note. If we look
up, God Himself will beat the time for us. With the
eye on Him we shall strike the next note full and clear.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Our Father, we would learn to trust Thy love,
to live so that Thy grace shall have in us its perfect
work. Not the easy thing is what we ask, but strength
for duty. Give us the confidence that Thou art by
our side. Let Thy strong touch be felt, Thy blessed
presence seen. In all the turmoil that rages within,
without, grant us Thy peace. In childish helplessness,
grant us the Father's help. To grow like Jesus
is our heart's desire. All things that Thy great
heart permits or sends, we would receive with gratitude,
that so our wills and lives may be in harmony
with Thine. And so day by day may something of
the Saviour's glory shine through us and bless and
brighten other lives in need. Amen.</p>

<i>Dawn and its silence draw a silver sigh<br />
Far in the east where early shadows lie<br />
All flocked and folded like soft peaceful sheep.<br />
The spirit of the spring stirs in its sleep,<br />
Breathes into life a misty floating sheen;<br />
The willows dreamy drip of constant green;<br />
Exultant beats a bird-heart o'er a nest,<br />
Where dim, vague stirrings 'neath the tiny breast<br />
Spell fresh the miracle of motherhood.<br />
Ah, how the world is young! ah, how 'tis good!<br />
To feel the new life flutter mystic wing;<br />
Like to a lark to feel one's soul upspring,<br />
Transpierce the very limit of the sky,<br />
And toss its challenge to Eternity!</i><br />

<p>O God, our heavenly Father, make our hearts
exultant, as the earth in the spring morning, with
the radiance of Thy Presence. Fill them with the
joy and hopefulness of eternal youth, and cause them
to be uplifted in gratitude and thankfulness to
Thee. We have seen earthly faces so beaming with
the light of love that we never shall forget them.
We have spoken names that are so endeared to us
that they will linger in our memory as long as we
live. So, O Father, may it be with Thy face and
Thy name. May Thy face beaming upon us as
the sun of righteousness win our love to holiness
and virtue, making us fruitful of good works, and
Thy name be so woven in our affections that we
shall cherish and hallow it forever. Amen.</p>

resting upon mutual services, and through that

Till all its strings were loose and frayed,<br />
Joy, Hate, and Fear, each one, assayed<br />
To play. But each in turn had found<br />
No sweet responsiveness of sound.</i><br />

The Harp he took all undismayed,<br />

<p>Heavenly Father, I pray Thee that Thou wilt
help me to love to-day. Thou art Love and if Thou
shalt fill my life there will be no room for hate and
no room for fear, for "Perfect Love casteth out fear."
As the Master stilled the waves in Galilee, so speak
Thou peace to my soul, and bid all discord cease,
that my whole life may be in tune with heaven,
and may be one happy song. Love alone can bring
harmony out of discord, love out of hate, trust out
of fear, and music out of a worn-out, or a long unused
or misused life. So let Love control the whole
of my life for Jesus' sake. Amen.</p>

<p>O, Thou who dwellest in the light, help Thy
children this morning to see the light of Thy truth
and feel the warmth of Thy love. We thank Thee
for the open doors of opportunity for helpful service;
for the exhibition of kindness and for growth in the
kingdom of Heaven. May we clearly see the way
to the Eternal life and have strength to walk therein.
May we so welcome Thy truth that we shall be free
from error and sin. May Thy wisdom so guide
our energies that we shall reach after greater perfection.
May the evening of this day find us more
in harmony with God than we now are. And may
the evening of life find us rich in the treasures of
heaven. Amen.</p>

<p>O Heavenly Father, we thank Thee that Thou
hast placed us where we are and hast given us the
work we have to do. We would not seek far and
wide for some better place or more honourable task.
We pray today for the spirit that shall make us
glad in our common toil. We need not to fly away
to find enjoyment; we have only to feel that in the
duties of this day we are in partnership with Thee,&mdash;then
shall we be happy that Thou hast called us to
so divine a fellowship. Make us strong and earnest
and brave&mdash;that when the evening shadows fall
we shall not look regretfully back because we have
been unfaithful,&mdash;but that we may be satisfied and
happy in the memory that we have been serving
with Thee. Amen.</p>

<p>Father Divine, we remember Thee at the beginning
of another day, and the obedience to Thy laws of
life which Thou dost require. About us is Thy
beautiful world, thrilling with new life. We would that
our lives today may be likewise beautiful, restrained
from sin against body and spirit. As there is now

In our hearts there is always the stirring energy of

heavenly sunshine. Let that warmth now stream
into our hearts that our lives today may show forth
Thy praise. Amen.</p>

like taking part in creation. When all outside is
cold and white, when the little children of the woodland
are gone to their nurseries in the warm earth and the
empty nests on the bare trees filled with snow, my
window-garden glows and smiles, making summer
within while it is winter without. It is wonderful
to see flowers bloom in the midst of a snow-storm! I
have felt a bud "shyly doff her green hood and blossom
with a silken burst of sound," while the icy fingers of
the snow beat against the window panes. What secret
power, I wonder, caused this blossoming miracle?
What mysterious force guided the seedling from the
dark earth up to the light, through leaf and stem and
bud, to glorious fulfilment in the perfect flower? Who
could have dreamed that such beauty lurked in the
dark earth, was latent in the tiny seed we planted?
Beautiful flower, you have taught me to see a little
way into the hidden heart of things. Now I understand
that the darkness everywhere may hold possibilities
better than even my hopes.</i></p></blockquote>

God of the Nations, we thank Thee today for
every heroic deed of every heroic soul. We rejoice
that in every hour of real emergency there have ever
been men who were ready to die for their country.
O Lord, may the memory of their sacrifice ever remain
to us and to the children of coming generations a
sacred heritage. Yet, O Lord, let us not be satisfied
to glorify their deeds with a memory. Let us do
them the higher honor of consecrating our lives to
the service of the country they loved. So shall we,
in the honor we render them find the title to our
honor. Thus in <i>our</i> land and in <i>our</i> time may Thy
Kingdom come and Thy will be done. Amen.

to love and to work and to play and to look up at the
stars; to be satisfied with your possessions, but not
contented with yourself until you have made the best
of them; to despise nothing in the world except falsehood
and meanness, and to fear nothing except cowardice;
to be governed by your admirations rather than
your dislikes; to covet nothing that is your neighbor's
except his kindness of heart and gentleness of manners;
to think seldom of your enemies, often of your friends,
and every day of Christ; and to spend as much time
as you can, with body and with spirit in God's out-of-doors&mdash;these

and know Thy life? Let us commune with Thy
gracious spirit and so learn Thy way. How beautiful
the vision which prayer unfolds to us when we worship
in spirit and truth! We see the virtues which
ennoble and sanctify other lives. Sweet and tender
patience appears and in her light ruffled and distorted
tempers are subdued and clothed in their
right mind. Faith is seen and as irresolution and
doubt take their flight, confident trust and cherished
conviction appear in magnetic power. So, O Lord,
would we read the signs which other lives present.
So would we strengthen our own aspirations and
make real the vision. So, O Father, would we find
Thy peace. Amen.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>It is only the sincerity of human feeling that abides.
As for a thought, we know not, it may be deceptive;
but the love, wherewith we have loved it, will surely
return to our soul; nor can a single drop of its clearness
or strength be abstracted by error. Of that perfect
ideal that each of us strives to build up in himself,
the sum total of all our thoughts will help only to
model the outline; but the elements that go to construct
it, and keep it alive, are the purified passion, unselfishness,
loyalty, wherein these thoughts have had
being.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>O God, our Heavenly Father, help us to take up
the cares of this day with an unselfish heart, and in
loyalty to what is right and good. Keep us in right
relation to those with whom our lot is cast, in sympathy
with the unanxious joy of the world and with the
deeper life which is its source. We desire to enter
into the thought and the love of the most hopeful
souls, that, in all the needful pauses of the day,
we may find cheer, incentive, and the ampler rest:
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>Our Heavenly Father, we thank Thee for this new
day. May it be an open door to faithful service.
Open our eyes that we may see all vexations,
distresses, and toil as angels in disguise sent to
strengthen and fulfil us, to prepare us for larger
blessings at our journey's end. As the blue sky of
Thy loving kindness is broader and more enduring
than the clouds that sometimes hide it, so teach us
to trust Thine unfailing love that overarches and
outlasts all weariness and pain. When life and
strength fail us here, may we find them transformed
and glorious in the city of God hereafter. Be Thou
our shield and our reward now and forever. Amen.</p>

<p>My voice shalt Thou hear in the morning, O Lord,
in the morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee,
and will look up; and looking up, may we not fail
to realize that, amid the turmoil of this outward
life, Thou art ever present to give peace and rest in
the inner life. Should we fail to recognize that presence
we shall lose the comfort which Thou art ever
ready to bestow, and must ourselves bear burdens
which Thou wouldst gladly bear for us or take from
us. Thou knowest our frame and rememberest that
we are dust. Open our spiritual vision to behold
that Divine resources are subject to our daily prayer.
In the name of Jesus, the Christ. Amen.</p>

what the trouble was. He found that it was sick of
life and determined to die, because it was not tall and
beautiful like the pine. The pine was out of heart
because it could not bear grapes like the vine; the
vine was going to throw its life away, because it could
not stand erect and have as fine fruit as the pomegranate;
and so on throughout the garden. Coming
to the heart'sease, the king found its bright face
uplifted, as full of cheerfulness as ever. Said the
king, "Well, heart'sease, I am glad to find one
brave little flower in this general discouragement and
dying. You don't seem one bit disheartened." "No,
your majesty. I know I am of small account; but
I concluded you wanted a heart'sease when you

Thy constant revelation of love in nature and in the
experiences of life. Give us strength so to will and
so to act that we may make this day rich in the joy
that comes from helpful living. May divine impulse
find quick expression in righteous deed. In Thine
unresting effort to make this world Thine own may we

<blockquote><p><i>A lily grows mysteriously, pushing up its solid
weight of stem and leaf in the teeth of gravity. Shaped
into beauty by secret and invisible fingers, the flower
develops we know not how. But we do not wonder at it.
Every day the thing is done; it is Nature, it is God.
We are spiritual enough at least to understand that.
But when the soul rises slowly above the world, pushing
up its delicate virtues in the teeth of sin, shaping
itself mysteriously into the image of Christ, we deny
that the power is not of man. A strong will, we say,
a high ideal, the reward of virtue, Christian influence&mdash;these
will account for it. Spiritual character is merely
the product of anxious work, self-command, and self-denial.
We allow, that is to say, a miracle to the lily,
but none to the man. The lily may grow; the man
must fret and toil and spin.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>The more simply you live, the more secure is your
future; you are less at the mercy of surprises and
reverses. An illness or a period of idleness does not
suffice to dispossess you; a change of position, even
considerable, does not put you to confusion. Having
simple needs, you find it less painful to accustom yourself
to the hazards of fortune. You remain a man,
though you lose your office or your income, because
the foundation on which your life rests is not your
table, your cellar, your horses, your goods and chattels,
or your money. In adversity you will not act like a
nursling deprived of its bottle and rattle. Stronger,
better armed for the struggle, presenting like those
with shaven heads, less advantage to the hands of
your enemy, you will also be of more profit to your
neighbor.</i></p></blockquote>

as Thou wouldst have us the fresh revelation and
energy of each morning hour. May we be helped

which Thou placest within our reach today. Freshen
our souls anew with the coming sunlight and
quicken our will that we may perceive and fulfil

both exactly the same age. So one day they went to a
wise magician, and asked him which of them ought to
be king after their father's death. "He who is most
worthy," said the magician. "But how shall we find
out who is most worthy?" "He who possesses the
magic flower that grows in the enchanted forest shall
be found most worthy," he answered. So the two
brothers travelled through the enchanted forest until
they found the magic flower; but it grew in such a
dangerous place that Carimel would not attempt to
reach it. Florimel, however, clambered down the rocks
and plucked the flower; and when he had got it, what
do you think he did with it? Why, he gave it to his
brother, for the name of that magic flower was Unselfishness.</i></p></blockquote>

said: "Before any of you came forth I was blooming
under the leaves and under the snow. Am I not the
flower of God?" And all the flowers cried out: "No,
you are no flower at all; you are a come-outer." And
then God's wind, blowing on the garden, brought this
message to them: "Little flowers, do you not know that
every flower that answers God's spring call, and comes
out of the cold, dark earth, and lifts its head above the
sod and blooms forth, catching the sunlight from God
and flinging it back to men, taking the sweet south
wind from God and giving it back to others in sweet
and blessed fragrance&mdash;do you not know they are all
God's flowers?"</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Our Heavenly Father, we thank Thee for the rest

This day we accept as a loving tribute of Thy Love to
Thy children. May we not mar it by unhallowed
thoughts, unkind, hasty and regretful speech and
shameful and evil deeds. May ours be the illumination
which comes from moral and spiritual conquest.
May we feel the ties that bind us tenderly to Thee
and to one another; and work for that large human
brotherhood, which holds in its strong embrace even
the most distant and isolated member of the human

to do our share in the building up of Thy kingdom
of love and righteousness, peace and good will here

<p>O Lord, we thank Thee for Thy manifold gifts
unto the children of men. Thou givest life and all
the sustenance of life. Thou givest our fair and
beautiful world. Thou givest us the power of hope
and faith and thought. From Thine own giving may
we learn that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
Teach us, O Lord, to give more freely and more gladly,
and may we learn how our own life, and joy and
growth are involved in the spirit in which we give and
serve. In all our giving and all our serving may we
keep before us the vision of the Master who gave
Himself that we might live. Amen.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>We all shrink, like cowards, from new duties, new
responsibilities. We do not venture to go out of the
beaten track of our daily life. Close to us, on each side
of the road, are those whom we might help or save with
one good action, one kind word. But we are afraid.
We say: "I am not prepared; I am not ready; I
have not time; I am not qualified; find some better
person; send some one else." Perhaps we have only
one talent, and, therefore, instead of using it, we hide
it, and when the Master comes we shall meet him with
the old answer: "I was afraid, and went and hid thy
talent in the earth. Lo! there thou hast that is thine."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>From the base sin of selfishness, O Lord, deliver us.
Teach us by Thy life of ministry and sacrifice for
others that the more fully and willingly we lose ourselves
in service for our fellowmen, the more surely
we shall find ourselves in Thee. As we go forth this
day in paths that Thou hast prepared for us, help us
to so forget ourselves in acts of kindness and words
of comfort that each one whom our lives may touch,
may become thereby a happier, purer, stronger soul.
Take Thou the care of these lives of ours, while, with
Thee, in busy streets and crowded shops where greed
is grasping and sin is lurking, we shall try to care for
souls of others, who need the help that we might give.
Then, at the eventide today or on the morrow, it will
be our joy like Thine to find ourselves again in hearts
made happy, in lives inspired, in souls redeemed.
Amen.</p>

<p>Father, we are shortsighted and weak, and hence
cannot do our best work without Thine aid. We rejoice
in the privileges and opportunities of this day.
Thou hast counted us worthy to work for Thee. Thou
canst use our loaves and fishes, but dost require us
to bring thus our little all for Thy blessing. We are
inspired with hope to make our consecration to Thee.
Make this a day of glorious service. Guide us in our
thoughts and work. Glorify Thyself in our life. And
wherever the close of this day may find us may it be
with the feeling that we have done our best by Thy
blessing and help. Amen.</p>

Therefore let it glow in me and through me light

God, who art the same, yesterday, today, yea, and

<p>Fill our souls with Thy light, O God, that we may
ever hope. Give us the poise of endless progress.
Make our souls free and joyous as the bird's wing.
Give us the courage of our convictions in all places,
under all conditions. Make us brave. Take away
all forms of fear, whether of man, of nature, or of Thee,
and make us feel that each is our mighty friend, but
Thou supreme over all, faithful each moment to our
being, in ten thousand sweet, true, tender, life-giving,
life-sustaining ministries. Teach us to look for Thee
everywhere, and to see Thy order, and Thy beauty,
facing all things Heavenward. May our ideals be
perfect holiness, perfect strength, perfect love, perfect
service. Make our faith great in the higher estate,
where our faculties, only dawning here, shall rise in a
glorious morning of the soul. Amen.</p>

Learn to tell a story. A well told story is as welcome as
a sunbeam in a sick room. Learn to keep your own
troubles to yourself. The world is too busy to care for
your ills and sorrows. Learn to do something for
others. Even if you are a bedridden invalid there is

and that is the surest way to attain happiness for
yourself.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>To Thee, O Author of our lives, we speak thanksgiving
and gratitude for Thy gifts of love and trust.
Help us to bring them into full exercise this day. By
them may we know the experience of burdens made
light and yokes made easy. With them, let us realize
that we are effective workers with Thee. Because of
them, show us how all our tasks are transformed to
divine endeavors. Through them, set free all other
of our highest impulses. So, O God, shall we know
the fulness of life, we and all our loved ones. So shall
we see doubt change to faith and blindness to vision.
So shall our influence through word and work be the
ministry of hope and of joy to any disconsolate, and
to any who are a weak guide to the source of strength.
For newness of life, for all the fruits of the spirit,
whereby the heart is ever young and in joyous companionship
with the Christ, for all this we pray now
and ever. Amen.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The child frightened in his play runs to seek his
mother. She takes him upon her lap and presses his
head to her bosom; and with tenderest words of love,
she looks down upon him and smooths his hair and
kisses his cheek, and wipes away his tears. Then, in a
low and gentle voice, she sings some sweet descant, some
lullaby of love; and the fear fades out from his face,
and a smile of satisfaction plays over it, and at length
his eyes close, and he sleeps in the deep depths and delights
of peace. God Almighty is the mother and the
soul is the tired child; and He folds it in His arms and
dispels its fears, and lulls it to repose, saying "Sleep,
my darling, sleep! It is I who watch thee."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Blessed Master! we thank Thee that every tired and

Each morning brings with it new cares, new duties,
new privileges, new responsibilities; for all these, we
need Thy protecting care, and pray for Thy divine
guidance. When wearied and burdened with the cares
of daily life, wilt Thou help us to flee to Thee as the
frightened child flees to the loving mother; and wilt
Thou encircle us with Thine arms of love, and whisper
in our ears words of comfort and cheer and of forgiveness.
Teach us to trust Thee in the morning, to
walk with Thee through the day, and to commit our
ways to Thee at all times. Amen.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Certainly there never was a busier life than that of
Jesus,&mdash;His whole great mission bounded by three
hurried years. Yet in the morning He says to His
friends: "Let us come apart and rest awhile;" and
again when the evening is come He is in the mountain
apart, alone. That is the place of worship in a world
of work. It is not a refuge from duty, or a shirking of
it; it is the renewal of power to meet one's duty and do
it. The work of life is not to be well done with a hot,
feverish, overwhelmed, and burdened mind; it is to be
well done with a mind calmed and fortified by moments
of withdrawal; and it is to be best done by one who
from time to time pulls himself up in his eager life and
permits God to speak to his soul.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>She was a droll little figure of a girl with a quaint old
face, that showed too early the lines of care and work, and
her clothing betokened a poverty-stricken home. Evidently
not much of brightness had touched her life, but
her face always lightened up when she mentioned her
school or her teacher. "Why is it that you love your
teacher so well?" she was asked one day. Her eyes
shone and her lips smiled happily as she replied,
"Because she's glad to me!" What a tribute was

<p>Almighty God, teach us how to be glad. Put some
gladness into our hearts. Show us where gladness
is hidden in our little world about us, so that we may
find it and use it. Give us the wisdom of Jesus, who,
although a Man of Sorrows, yet spake ever of His joy
and His peace. We feel that the secret of things must
be gladness, that somehow there is a covered joy even
in what we call our sufferings. Let us find that. Keep
our hearts pure of the soiling of evil desire, for we
know that no gladness can come from the muddy
fountains of sin. Let our hands be busy at some good
part of the world's work, for we know that idleness
never went hand in hand with joy. Let our minds
be open to acknowledge, love and obey the truth, for
we feel that truth alone can satisfy our hearts. And
let us feel to-day the duty of gladness we owe to our
fellow-creatures. Let us give to them what we would
receive from Thee. Amen.</p>

<p>No discontent could harass us if we had a deeper

We praise Thee, therefore, that we may be rooted and
grounded in Christ. And that our little lives may
glorify Him by bringing forth abundant fruit. Thou
dost give us the holy privilege of being co-laborers
with Thee in the salvation of needy humanity. Around
us are the countless opportunities for ennobling and
gladdening the lives of those whose courage burns low,
or who have never known the transforming companionship
of Christ. We would not forget that we
are debtors to Thee and to that great Host whose love
and service has inspired us. May we be not selfish
takers only, but generous givers. May there be less
gloom, fewer shackles, less guilt in the world because
we are mastered by the spirit of Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>Our Father in Heaven, we awake this morning with
a sense of thankfulness for the beauty and glory of
Thy creation. We praise Thee that as Thy children
we can be conscious of the kingdom of heaven always
about us. So we pray for that attitude of mind and
spirit of soul that will unlock for us the divine life.
Help us to be conscious of Thee in all the varied experiences
of this day. If it shall be a day of burdens,
give us strength to play our part uncomplainingly, if
a day of joy to accept it with true gratitude; and
when the shades of night shall call us to our rest, may
our memory of the day bring us peace. Amen.</p>

<p>We thank Thee, heavenly Father, for the days just
as they come. Nor would we measure the sunshine
against the storm as if to test Thy goodness by some
petty form of bookkeeping. Thou presidest over all
our days, and whatever may be the face of nature we
trust Thy love. Let us go forth today, not in critical
mood nor despondent mood but in the mood of high
Christian faith, anxious, not to test Thy providence,
but ready to do our own part, taking care to hold our
cup of blessing open-side up; so shall it catch the
manna when it falls. Then shall each passing day
be full of blessing. Amen.</p>

<p>Dear Father, we thank Thee for the year now coming
to its close, and for all that has blessed us in it.
Help us to keep the good wherewith it has done us
good in lasting memory. By the flight of time which
its passing emphasizes move us to earnestness in the
labors committed to our hands. Beyond this help us
that we may be undisturbed, remembering that Thou
art our dwelling place, and that we are the children
of Thy love and the sharers of Thy everlastingness.
So may we keep the vision of youth, the vision to
which endings are but beginnings, the good leading
to the better, and the best forever more. May Thy
blessing be upon all whom we love and should pray
for in this and every day, in Jesus' name. Amen.</p>

<p>Our Heavenly Father, we stand upon the utmost
verge of the old year. Forgetting the things that are
behind, we stand with our faces looking earnestly into
the future. We do not despise the past, we do not
forget its manifold blessings. We do not forget that
Thou hast been with us in the old year; for all this
we would be grateful. With clear vision and earnestness
of purpose, we would stand looking into the
future expectantly, ready for its duties and its responsibilities;
yet not ostentatiously nor with over-confidence,
for we know our own infirmities, our own
weaknesses. We would enter upon the New Year
with confidence, not because of our own strength, but
because of Thy living presence. Thou art always
with us, Thou art pouring out Thy spirit upon us.
O Lord, let us believe in Thee, and believing, let us
have a heart for any fate. Amen.</p>

<p>O Thou, who didst not spare Thine own Son,
but didst deliver Him up for us all, we cannot ask
Thee to withhold us from our Gethsemane nor even
from our Calvary. But when Thou callest us to
go down into the gloom or up to the cross, remember,
O God, that we are dust. Might we so dwell with
Thee in Thy secret place, as to abide under Thy
shadow! There, sheltered and unafraid, we should
sustain the rod as eager for its chastening stroke,
praying only for wisdom to learn its lesson and
acquire its discipline. With the picture of the crucified
Savior before us, we only cry this day as He
taught us, Thy will be done. Amen.</p>

The Holy One of God, despised and slain,<br />
With nail-torn hands and feet, and spear-pierced side,<br />
His gentle brow by mocking thorns defaced;<br />
See where He lies, obedient unto death.<br />
Into that pallid face the glow of life<br />
Begins to steal, while silent and in awe<br />
The heavenly watchers stand. Now they with haste<br />
Unwind the scented wrappings from His form<br />
That fill the place with rich aromas rare,<br />
Perfume of spicery and sweet spikenard's breath<br />
Lingering since Love her alabastron broke,<br />
And with her tresses wiped these tear-bathed feet.<br />
And then, their joyful faces all aglow<br />
Like flashing sunbeams, quickly by a touch<br />
They roll away the stone with jarring shock,<br />
As if an earthquake passed, and sitting there<br />
Behold their Lord go forth, Death's Conqueror!</i></p>

through Thy gospel that "life is ever lord of death."
"Thou didst not suffer Thy Holy One to see corruption,"
and we trust that because He lives we
shall live also. O grant that, believing in Him,
we may not see death save as a door to more abounding
life, and so realize our privilege daily to be risen
with Him in the newness and power of an endless
life. Amen.</p>

<p>Fresh from the Gates of Heaven, our Father,
this dear child has come, opening in our hearts
springs of new and deeper affection. We thank Thee
for this life whose coming has filled our lives with
sunshine. Teach us how to live that we may guide
it aright, so that as the years pass more and more
sunlight shall be radiated. Even as Thine angels
kissed the sweet rosebud lips and left a smile thereon,
so may we kiss away the tears of life. Heavenly
Father, we consecrate this child to Thy service.
We pray that the ears may learn to listen for Thy
voice, speaking in truth and purity. May the tiny
hands be ever ready to do a service of love and may
the feet be swift to do Thy bidding. Tenderly
guide this precious child, for it needs Thy guidance,
and safely guard it through all the years, lest it go
astray. This we ask in the name of Him who took
little children in His arms and blessed them, saying&mdash;"Suffer
little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of
Heaven." Amen.</p>

<p>A Father's Birthday</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The boy enjoyed this kind of a father at the time,
and later he came to understand, with a grateful
heart, that there is no richer inheritance in all the
treasury of unearned blessings. For, after all, the
love, the patience, the kindly wisdom of a grown man
who can enter into the perplexities and turbulent
impulses of a boy's heart, and give him cheerful
companionship, and lead him on by free and
joyful ways to know and choose the things that are
pure and lovely and of good report, make as fair an
image as we can find of that loving, patient Wisdom
which must be above us all if any good is to come out
of our childish race.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>General Birthday</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Birthdays, what are they? One will say they are
mileposts on the highway of life, marking the distance
already traveled and suggesting what yet remains of
the journey. Another looking into the deeper meaning
of the years will suggest that they are memorial tablets
recording the service of a passing life. But no matter
under what figure you think of them, the coming into
this world of a human life with all the magic powers
of thought and love and faith and service is a thing
of such transcendent moment, as to make it well worth

the wealth it feeds upon; for love, and all the forms
of love which answer to it; for faith which looks on
Thee and heaven; for service, the exercise and opportunity
of every gift and grace. Help us to be
faithful that our felicity may be secure in Thee, and

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
